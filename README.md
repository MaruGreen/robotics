# Robotics

#### I will share some codes from my PhD research about robotics.

##### The Transform.py is a class to calculate the robot pose transformation automatically. You will find it useful when coding in python in ROS. I like using both C++ and python in my ROS projects. In C++, ROS provides the convenient tool of tf::Transform to process the robot poses while the python does not. I simply translate the major part of this class into python so as to enjoy the convenience in every node of the ROS projects.
